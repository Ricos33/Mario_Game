# Mario_Game

Welcome to my Mario-inspired game, built with Flutter and Dart! This project combines my love for gaming with my passion for coding, showcasing what I can do with state management and UI design.


# What Youâ€™ll Find Here

    Character Movement: You can make Mario run, dash, and jumpâ€”just like the classic! Iâ€™ve focused on making the controls smooth and responsive for a fun gameplay experience.
    Stateful and Stateless Widgets: I used both types of widgets to manage the gameâ€™s state effectively, ensuring everything from animations to UI updates works seamlessly.
    Multiple Pages: The game includes various pages, making navigation easy and intuitive. You can switch between levels, settings, and high scores without a hitch.

# Technical Highlights

    Built with Flutter: I took advantage of Flutterâ€™s rich widget library to create a vibrant and engaging interface.
    Smooth Animations: I implemented animations that make character movements feel natural and lively.
    Responsive Design: The game is designed to look great on any screen size, so you can enjoy it whether youâ€™re on a phone or a tablet.

# Getting Started

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Run flutter pub get to install the necessary dependencies.
    Start the game with flutter run and jump right in!

Iâ€™d love for you to check out the code, and any feedback or contributions are more than welcome. Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®
